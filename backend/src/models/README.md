# Models

This directory contains data models that represent the structure of data in the database.

Models should:
- Be named according to the resource they represent (e.g., `User.js`, `Sensor.js`)
- Define the schema/structure of the data
- Include any necessary validation rules
- Contain methods for database operations related to that resource
