# Routes

This directory contains route definitions that map HTTP requests to controller functions.

Routes should:
- Be organized by resource (e.g., `userRoutes.js`, `sensorRoutes.js`)
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Include necessary middleware (authentication, validation)
- Follow RESTful conventions where possible
